short_bio:
  <p>
    I am a second-year Master’s student in Computer Science and Engineering at The Ohio State University, advised by <a href="http://shocheen.com/">Prof. Kumar Sachin</a>. Previously, I was fortunate to be advised by <a href="http://cfda.csie.org/~cjwang/">Dr. Chuan-Ju Wang</a> at Academia Sinica, and by <a href="https://www.cs.nccu.edu.tw/~mftsai/">Prof. Ming-Feng Tsai</a> during my undergraduate studies at National Chengchi University.
  </p>

  <p>
    My research lies in natural language processing (NLP), Information Retrieval (IR)  and large language models (LLMs), with a focus on improving their efficiency, reliability, and deployment in real-world applications.
  </p>

  <p>
    Currently, I am exploring techniques to accelerate and stabilize LLMs—such as fast inference and decoding methods—alongside efforts to develop robust evaluation benchmarks for medical and other high-stakes domains. My work often involves collaboration with hospitals, schools, and public sector organizations to ensure these models are not only effective but also trustworthy and practically usable.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am passionate about connecting core ML research with real-world impact, and working closely with practitioners and policymakers to turn innovative ideas into actionable, socially meaningful solutions.
